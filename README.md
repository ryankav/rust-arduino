# rust-arduino
Repository for developing rust code to run on the arduino uno

## Thanks

The initial setup for this repository was taken from the [avr-hal-template](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal-template) but simplified for my own use as don't have access to every board that the template contains

### TODO

Need to probably add read write access to the serial device appropriately a few posts out there about setting rules for the serial ports which might make it easier
